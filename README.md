# Baseline Deep Learning Detectors for Radar Detection in the 3.5 GHz CBRS Band
---
## Project Objective
This project aims to create a comprehensive framework for generating radio frequency (RF) datasets, designing deep learning (DL) detectors, and evaluating their detection performance using both simulated and experimental test data. The proposed tools and techniques are developed in the context of dynamic spectrum use for the 3.5 GHz Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS), but they can be utilized and expanded for standardization of machine learned spectrum awareness technologies and methods.
